> A lightweight, intelligent engine that scores, filters, and delivers **proactive messages** based on real-time events and user behavior—designed for chatbot platforms like **Kore.ai**, **Dialogflow**, or any custom stack.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional bots wait for user input. This project flips that model using **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**—proactively engaging users when a meaningful system event occurs, like a failed payment, delivery delay, or login anomaly.

It includes:
- An event scoring engine
- Dynamic user engagement tracking
- A pluggable notification layer
- Simulated message dispatch and behavioral response learning

---

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ Event scoring with dynamic thresholds  
✅ Personalized prioritization via engagement learning  
✅ Noise reduction with context-aware suppression  
✅ Pluggable message templates  
✅ Developer-friendly codebase with comments and logs  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `datetime`, `random`, `time` (standard libs)
- [Optional in roadmap] Flask, SQLite, Kafka, FastAPI, ML libraries

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Event occurs (e.g., `payment_failed`).
2. Bot Optimizer scores the event based on:
   - Base importance
   - Past user engagement
3. If score > threshold, a proactive message is sent.
4. Simulated user behavior (click or ignore) is tracked.
5. Score tuning happens based on engagement.

## 🧭 Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Enhancements
- [x] Event prioritization logic
- [x] Simulated engagement tracking
- [ ] Persistent storage (e.g., SQLite)
- [ ] Config management with YAML or JSON
- [ ] Logging instead of print()

### 🚀 Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Webhook receiver (Flask/FastAPI)
- [ ] Kore.ai integration (proactive dialog triggers)
- [ ] Kafka or AWS SNS as event source

### 🤖 Phase 3: Intelligence
- [ ] ML-based scoring (XGBoost or Sklearn)
- [ ] Behavioral time-based personalization
- [ ] Dynamic message template selection

### 🧪 Phase 4: Deployment & UI
- [ ] Dockerize the app
- [ ] Streamlit dashboard for event & engagement analytics
- [ ] API + UI demo frontend

## 📸 Example Output

```plaintext
[2025-06-05 09:12:42] Event 'payment_failed' for User user1 scored 0.85
📤 Sending proactive message to User user1:
👉 'Your recent payment failed. Want to try another card?'

🧠 Engagement recorded: Clicked ✅
